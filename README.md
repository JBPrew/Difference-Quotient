This program will take any input any function of x and return its differnce quotient step-by-step. Whole number (Non-negative integers) powers are accepted. Working on allowing negative integers. Must include cooeficient even if it is 1

Put in an x value to determine the derivative of the function at that point. The derivative with respect to x (d/dx) is also printed if you wanted to plug in other values into your calculator
